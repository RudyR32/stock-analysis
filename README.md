# stock-analysis
Stock Analysis through use of VBA 
### Challenge
For this Analysis we created a macro to calculate the Total Volume, Start and Ending Prices and the Return by percentage of stocks(that we have data for).  We also gave the Macro the utility to be able to pull data from either the 2017 or 2018 data.  Additionally we created a button to run the Macro for the Analysis as well as a Macro to clear the Sheet.  After we created the original Macro we refactored it to remove the nested loops so that the Macro would run faster(this would be come more important if we were to us a larger data set).  Additionally, we added formatting so that the report was easy to read and conditional formatting so that stocks that yeild positive and negative returns were easily identifible.
